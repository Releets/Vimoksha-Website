Hi! I am Vimoksha, thank you for checking out my webpage!

export const aboutMe = `
I am a singer, songwriter and perfomer with roots from Bosnia and Hercegovina, currently living in Norway. 
I have been creating music since I was a small child, and it has always been my biggest passion - 
my escape from reality and it is my greatest joy to create music for myself and others to enjoy. 
Through my diverse origins, the many people I have worked with, love for music and many, 
many years of experience, I have created a diverse and strong musical vocabulary. 
From ethnic folk music to modern pop, rock & roll to musicals and opera - there is close to nothing I don't enjoy working on.
My artist portfolio includes stage, TV and Radio-perfomrances, awards and first-place medals in singing competitions, 
and a collection recorded and published songs, all written, composed and performed by me.
